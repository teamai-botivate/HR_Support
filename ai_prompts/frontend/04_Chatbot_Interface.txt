Act as an expert Frontend Developer. We are continuing the "Botivate HR Support" React project.

Step Task:
1. Build the Main Chatbot Interface. Remember the core rule: "Chatbot = Only Door". There are no complex forms or dashboards for employees. Everything happens through the chat.
2. The Chat UI must look like a premium, modern messenger (e.g., similar to Intercom or a sleek custom ChatGPT UI). It needs a large reading area, distinct message bubbles for the User and AI, and an input bar with attachment support.
3. Build a "Notification Bell" system in the top corner. For Managers/HR, this bell will show pending actionable approvals. For Employees, it will show status updates (e.g., "Request Approved").
4. Build interactive message components inside the chat. For example, if a Manager receives an approval request alert in their chat, render interactive "Approve" and "Reject" buttons directly inside the chat bubble itself.
5. Make sure the component is completely flexible, connected to React state, and avoids hardcoded chat flows. Provide the complete code for this beautiful chat wrapper.
