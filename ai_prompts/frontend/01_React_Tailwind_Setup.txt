Act as an expert Frontend Developer. We are building the User Interface for a dynamic HR System called "Botivate HR Support".
Design Focus: Professional, Minimalist UI, premium feeling, smooth micro-animations.
Tech Stack: React, Tailwind CSS.

Step Task:
1. Initialize the React app and properly configure Tailwind CSS without any messy configurations. Define a vibrant but professional color palette and ensure it naturally supports Dark Mode.
2. Create the main generic layout components for the Single Page Application (Navbar, Main Container, Footer).
3. Build a set of highly reusable, premium-looking modern UI components using Tailwind: Custom Buttons (with hover effects), Input Fields, clean Cards with soft shadows, and Modals.
4. Because the system supports multiple companies, the UI must feel neutral, sleek, and premium for any brand. 
5. Do NOT hardcode any company logos, colors, or names. Make the foundational UI code highly modular and editable. Provide the complete setup and the structure for these base components.
