Act as an expert Backend Developer. We are building a dynamic Multi-Company HR System called "Botivate HR Support". 
Tech Stack: FastAPI, Pydantic, Python.

Step Task:
1. Initialize the FastAPI application with proper CORS settings.
2. We need a dynamic database connection system. Create an abstract interface (Base Adapter) for database connections so we can easily plug in any database in the future (like PostgreSQL, MongoDB).
3. For now, implement the default database adapter for "Google Sheets". 
4. The system must support multiple companies. Every company will have an isolated environment. Create a "master database" structure (using SQLite or a simple JSON file for now, which can be changed later) to store registered companies and their configurations.
5. Provide the exact folder structure and all the code required for this initial setup. 
6. Very Important: Ensure the code is highly flexible, modular, and has NO hardcoded company details, API keys, or logic. Make it clean and production-ready.
