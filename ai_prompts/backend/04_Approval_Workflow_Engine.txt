Act as an expert Backend Developer. We are continuing the "Botivate HR Support" FastAPI project.

Step Task:
1. Build the Approval Workflow Engine. The system follows a "Zero Auto-Approval Policy". This means the AI itself can NEVER approve any request.
2. If an employee asks the AI for something that needs approval (like a Leave Request or Resignation), the AI must record this transaction in the database as "Pending" with a specific timestamp.
3. The system must immediately send a notification request to the higher authority (Manager, HR, CEO) including the employee details and the context of the request.
4. Give the AI the ability to mark a request as "Urgent" if the user specifies it.
5. Build background logic (like a cron job or background task) to check for pending requests. Apply these rules dynamically: Send a reminder after 48 hours, and escalate after 72 hours.
6. Create endpoints for authorities to formally Approve or Reject these requests. Ensure every single action writes immediately to the database (Google Sheet / DB) to maintain a complete audit trail.
7. Ensure the code is modular so that any new type of workflow event can be added in the future without breaking the core system.
