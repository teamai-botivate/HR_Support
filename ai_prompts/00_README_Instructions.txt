Read this first before generating the AI system.

HOW TO USE THESE PROMPTS:
1. The prompts are divided into two main folders: `backend` and `frontend`.
2. First, complete the Backend by copying the prompts inside the `backend` folder one by one.
3. Always wait for the AI to completely generate the code for a step before pasting the next prompt.
4. Once the Backend is fully built, move to the `frontend` folder and follow the same sequence.
5. Do not modify the prompts; just copy the text inside the files and paste it to ChatGPT / Claude / AI. 
6. These prompts are written in simple English but contain all the instructions for the AI to build your fully dynamic, multi-company HR system exactly as mentioned in your complete workflow document.
